ðŸ“– Assignment 2 â€“ Factory Method & Abstract Factory (Vehicles)
1. Introduction

This project demonstrates two important Creational Design Patterns in Java:

Factory Method Pattern â†’ creates one product at a time using subclasses.

Abstract Factory Pattern â†’ creates families of related products without specifying their concrete classes.

The chosen domain is Vehicles (Car + Bike), which keeps the implementation simple and easy to explain.

2. Factory Method Pattern
ðŸ”¹ Concept

Defines an interface for creating objects.

Subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Promotes loose coupling between client and concrete classes.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation

Vehicle â†’ interface (common method: drive())

Car and Bike â†’ concrete products

VehicleFactory â†’ factory interface

CarFactory and BikeFactory â†’ concrete factories

FactoryDemo â†’ demonstrates usage

ðŸ”¹ How it Works

Instead of creating objects directly (new Car() / new Bike()), the client calls the factory.
The factory decides which object to return.

Example Output:

Driving a Car
Riding a Bike


Benefit:

Client code is independent of concrete classes.

Adding a new type (e.g., Truck) only requires a new factory, without modifying client code.

3. Abstract Factory Pattern
ðŸ”¹ Concept

Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.

Ensures products from the same family are compatible.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation

Vehicle â†’ interface

Car and Bike â†’ product classes (with region-specific behavior)

VehicleFactory â†’ abstract factory interface

EuropeFactory and AsiaFactory â†’ concrete factories

AbstractFactoryDemo â†’ demonstrates usage

ðŸ”¹ How it Works

EuropeFactory â†’ creates EuropeCar and EuropeBike.

AsiaFactory â†’ creates AsiaCar and AsiaBike.

The client switches between product families simply by switching factories.

Example Output:

Europe Car driving
Europe Bike riding
Asia Car driving
Asia Bike riding


Benefit:

Supports multiple product families (e.g., Europe, Asia, America).

Adding a new region only requires a new factory, not changes in the client.

4. Clean Code Principles Applied

Meaningful Names â†’ clear, descriptive classes and methods.

Single Responsibility â†’ each class has one clear purpose (e.g., CarFactory only creates cars).

Open/Closed Principle â†’ open for extension (add new products/factories), closed for modification.

Separation of Concerns â†’ product logic is separate from creation logic.

Readability â†’ small, simple classes with consistent naming.

5. Conclusion

Factory Method â†’ best for creating single products with flexibility.

Abstract Factory â†’ best for creating families of products, ensuring compatibility across types.

This assignment demonstrates how design patterns improve maintainability, extensibility, and code cleanliness.
